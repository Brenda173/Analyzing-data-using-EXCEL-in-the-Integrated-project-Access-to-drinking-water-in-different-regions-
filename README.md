# Analyzing-data-using-EXCEL-in-the-Integrated-project-Access-to-drinking-water-in-different-regions-
I used EXCEL to analyze the data from several regions in the world from 2015 to 2020 and came up with several conclusions.
I came up with the rang of the year (year_diff) and created it's histograms. I also calculated the Annual  Rates of Change (ARC) in national, urban and rural in various regions, and generated it's histogram.
I used pivot tables to determine the number of countries per region.
From the data, I came up with the following decisions:

The distribution of the year column is neither normal nor negatively or positively skewed since there are two distinct peaks (2015 and 2020).
Some countries had a 0% Annual Rates of Change in national, urban and rural areas whereby in national=16 countries, rural=5 countries, urban=38 countries.
South Sudan and Morocoo countries had the highest absolute difference between urban and rural Annual Rates of Change, South Sudan=2.4888, Morocco=2.3293.
Sub-Saharan region saw the greatest improvement in access to basic water services on a national level 
(considering the Annual Rates of Change) over the dataset time period
